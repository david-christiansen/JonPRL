JonPRL is a proof refinement logic in the sense of Î»-PRL or
[Nuprl](http://www.nuprl.org); JonPRL inherits its [computational type
theory](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570868305000704)
from Allen, Bickford, Constable, Harper and many other names.

### Building & Installing JonPRL

JonPRL uses SML/NJ's [CM](http://www.smlnj.org/doc/CM/) for its build.  First
make sure you have SML/NJ set up properly. Then, install JonPRL's dependencies:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then, JonPRL may be built using its `Makefile`:

```sh
make smlnj
make test
```

This puts a binary in `./bin/jonprl`. Optionally, you may install JonPRL globally using:

```sh
sudo make install
```

#### Emacs Mode

Optionally, you may install the [JonPRL Mode for
Emacs](https://github.com/david-christiansen/jonprl-mode).

### Running JonPRL

To run JonPRL, simply direct it at your development:

```sh
jonprl example/test.jonprl
```

You may specify as many files as you like in this command; they will be refined
in order, in case of any dependencies.
